      <h1>1903 | The Wright Flyer</h1>
      <p>
        <mark>
          The Wright brothers inaugurated the aerial age with the world's first
          successful flights of a powered heavier-than-air flying machine.<br />
          The Wright Flyer was the product of a sophisticated four-year program
          of research and development conducted <br />by Wilbur and Orville
          Wright beginning in 1899. <br />After building and testing three
          full-sized gliders, the Wrights' first powered airplane flew at Kitty
          Hawk, North Carolina,<br />
          on December 17, 1903, making a 12-second flight, traveling 36 m (120
          ft), with Orville piloting. <br />The best flight of the day, with
          Wilbur at the controls, covered 255.6 m (852 ft) in 59 seconds.
