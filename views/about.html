          By 1899, the Orville and Wilbur Wright had become seriously interested
          in the problem of human flight. After they exhausted the references
          locally available to them, they wrote to the Smithsonian Institution
          in Washington, D.C., for further information. <br />When they read the
          works of others, particularly Lilienthal, Octave Chanute, and Samuel
          Pierpont Langley, they realized the one factor that had prevented
          others from achieving successful flight was the pilot's lack of
          ability to balance and control the craft once it was airborne.
          <br />They believed the other difficulties of propulsion and
          determining the most efficient wing shape were minor in comparison, or
          had already been solved.
